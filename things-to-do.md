1. more stories
    this means more backend work to get more prompts
    sending them to the frontend with endpoints

2. storing submissions
    when users drop submissions, they should be stored in my db

3. examples of functionality
    this means screenshots or gifs of what going through a story looks like

4. login/logout
    as it stands right now, i just have the functionality in my console
    a logged in user needs to be displayed
    stories they saved should be available
